Siena support for Play! Framework
=================================

play-siena is a module for [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.com) that adds support for [Siena](http://www.sienaproject.com/)

Currently the module only only supports Google App Engine persistence manager. So it is intended to be used along with [GAE module](http://www.playframework.org/modules/gae) for Play!
